# identicon

## Tutorial Source
This is actually a beginner project from udemy.  Don't really need to use `vue create` for this.  
Simple html + main.js would be enough with [jdenticon](https://jdenticon.com/) but just as a practice

npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
